# d3-dataviz-project-1-goren-hammer-animation
An animation of the Goren Hammer/Hammer Dodge from Sasuke using D3..

I made this project on VizHub, exported the code, and then used Vite to make the repository for this code.

To see this, the only route I know of is getting Vite.

Download Vite, and then input this command in the terminal.
```
  npm create vite@latest
```
Name the project however you like.
Choose **Vanilla** and **Javascript**.
Then follow the instructions in the terminal.

Instead of npm run dev, however, if you're using VSC, type 

```
  code .
```
Then you can input "npm run dev" in the VSC terminal (Type **CTRL + SHIFT + `**)

You can copy the code in the src folder to your VSC repository.
